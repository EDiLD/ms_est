Some journals require a graphical entry for the Table of Contents.
This should be laid out ``print ready'' so that the sizing of the
text is correct.

Inside the \texttt{tocentry} environment, the font used is Helvetica
8\,pt, as required by \emph{Journal of the American Chemical
Society}.

The surrounding frame is 9\,cm by 3.5\,cm, which is the maximum
permitted for  \emph{Journal of the American Chemical Society}
graphical table of content entries. The box will not resize if the
content is too big: instead it will overflow the edge of the box.

This box and the associated title will always be printed on a
separate page at the end of the document.

\section{Introduction}

% Small waterbodies

% runoff during rainfall (Liess et al. 1999)

% underestiamtion of grab sampling (Stehle et al. 2013). 


The aim of this study was 
(i) to compile monitoring data on a national scale and to answer the questions: \\
(ii) Is the data a representative description of the pollution situation? \\
(iii) Are small agricultural waters more polluted compared to bigger streams? Are there thresholds? \\
(iv)  How polluted are small streams and which pesticides are responsible?


\section{Methods}
\subsection{Data compilation}

We queried chemical monitoring data of pesticides from sampling sites with catchment size $\mathrm{< 100km^2}$ for the years 2005 to 2015 from all 13 non-city federal states of Germany.
Additionally, we compiled data available from previous studies and searched online databases.
This yielded to a total of more then 30 datasets of different formats.

We homogenized and unified these datasets into a common database.
We implemented a robust and transparent data cleaning work flow \citep{poisot_best_2015}, though parts of the dataset are proprietary.
An overview of the data cleaning process is provided in the supplemental materials.  
The compiled dataset comprised only a small fraction of standing waters and most of the samples where sampled via grab sampling.
Therefore, we report  only results for grab sampling from streams.  \todo{move to results and say that nearly no information on standing waters is available}
To assess whether  grab samples were taken during potential rainfall events we intersected sampling coordinates and date with daily precipitation data \citep{rauthe_central_2013}.

\subsection{Characterization of chemical pollution}
We characterized chemical pollution using three indicators:

\begin{enumerate}
\item National and international Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) \citep{ogewv_verordnung_2011,european_union_directive_2013}:
We used only Maximum Annual Concentration EQS (MAC-EQS) for characterization.

\item Regulatory Acceptable Concentrations (RAC) \citep{brock_linking_2010}:
This is the lowest concentration at which no acceptable biological effects are expected. 
These are derived during regulatory approval  process of pesticides and contains a uncertainty factor.
The German Federal Environmental Agency provided RACs for this study.

\item Maximum Toxic Units ($\mathrm{TU_{max}}$)  \citep{sprague_measurement_1970}: 
\begin{equation}
TU_{max} = max(\frac{C_i}{EC_{50, D.magna, i}})
\end{equation}

Were $C_i$ is the concentration of compound $i$ in a sample and $EC_{50, D.magna, i}$ is the concentration of this compound where 50\% of the exposed animals showed after 48 hours an effect in a laboratory study.
We compiled $EC_{50, D.magna}$ values from literature \citep{malaj_organic_2014}, databases \citep{pesticide_action_network_pan_2015,u.s._epa_ecotoxicology_2015} or model predictions \citep{schuurmann_quantitative_2011}, where experimental data had priority.
We used the maximum TU per sample, as it is independent of the number of measured compounds and makes no assumptions on the mode of action.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Characterization of catchments}
We delineated catchments upstream of the sampling sites using a digital elevation model \citep{eea_digital_2013} and a multiple flow direction algorithm \citep{holmgren_multiple_1994} as implemented in GRASS GIS 7 \citep{neteler_grass_2012}.
Catchment delineation has been manually checked for accuracy. 
In areas with low relief energy the delineation algorithm did not produce accurate results and we used river catchments provide by federal state authorities in these cases.
For each catchment we calculated the relative coverage (\%) with agricultural areas based on Official Topographical Cartographic Information System (ATKIS) of the land survey authorities.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Overview and representativeness of compiled data}

We compiled a national scale dataset  comprising 42236 samples from 3049 sampling sites (Figure \ref{fig:fig1} and Supplement). 
We found big differences in the number of sampling sites between federal states.

The dataset include 484
