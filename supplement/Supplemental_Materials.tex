\chapter{Data Cleaning}
Each of more then 30 datasets have been cleaned and homogenized separately, before combing in a common database.
Cleaning steps comprised (Figure~\ref{fig:data_cleaning} gives a graphical overview).

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Structure: Structure has been adjusted to the database structure.
	\item Coordinates: Coordinates have been transformed to a common Coordinate Reference System (DHDN / 3-Grad Gauss-Krüger Zone 3 (EPSG:31467) and duplicates merged.
	\item Chemicals: Chemical names and identifiers have been unified using the webchem package \citep{szocs_webchem:_2016}.
	\item  Identifiers: Unique identifiers have been assigned.
	\item Units: All concentrations have been converted to $\mu g/L$. Values below limit of quantification have be set to zero.
	\item Other meta-data: meta-data has been standardised.
	\item Temporal resolution: The temporal resolution of the database is 1 day. Date below this resolution has been aggregated by maximum.
	\item Validity Checks: Simple rules for validity checks have been implemented (e.g. no negative concentrations).
\end{enumerate}
